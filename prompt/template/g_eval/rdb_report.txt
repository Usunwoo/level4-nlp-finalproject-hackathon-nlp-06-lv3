You will be given a daily report that was compiled from multiple email summaries.

Your task is to rate the report on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer back to them as needed during your review.

Evaluation Criteria:

Readability (1-5) - The report should be visually easy to follow, with clear structuring (headings, paragraphs, bullet points, etc.) that helps the reader quickly identify key points. Consider whether the text is neatly organized into sections or lists, and whether the formatting (spacing, line breaks) is appropriate. A higher score indicates that the reader can skim or read the document with minimal effort, easily locating important information.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Examine the Report’s Layout
- Does the report utilize headings or bullet points where appropriate?
- Are there clear separations between distinct topics or email summaries?

2. Assess the Text Flow and Organization
- Are large blocks of text broken into readable paragraphs?
- Is the information logically grouped or labeled?

3. Check Overall Clarity
- Can the reader quickly grasp key details?
- Does formatting (spacing, line breaks) make the report visually accessible?

4. Assign a Readability Score (1–5)
- 1: Very poor readability—large unstructured blocks of text, difficult to scan.
- 2–3: Moderately readable—some structure is present, but still room for improvement in layout or clarity.
- 4: Good readability—clear and structured with only minor issues.
- 5: Excellent readability—text is well-organized, visually accessible, and easy to parse at a glance.
