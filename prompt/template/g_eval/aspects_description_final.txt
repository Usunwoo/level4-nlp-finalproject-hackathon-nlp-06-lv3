Clearance (1-5) - The report should minimize or eliminate duplicated information, outdated details, and any extraneous content. A higher score indicates the content is streamlined, containing only current, necessary, and distinct details without repetitive or obsolete information.
Coherence (1-5) - The report should be well-structured and well-organized. Each section or paragraph should flow logically from one to the next. The report should not read like a disjointed set of statements copied from separate emails, but rather form a coherent narrative or overview of the day’s content. A score of 1 indicates very poor coherence (confusing or disjointed); a score of 5 indicates excellent coherence (clear, logical flow).
Consistency (1-5) - The report must accurately reflect the factual content presented in the original emails. Any statements in the report should be supported by at least one email’s content; no invented or contradictory information should appear. A factually consistent report does not introduce details that are contradicted by or absent from the original emails. A score of 1 indicates the report is highly inconsistent (contains significant factual errors or hallucinated details), while a score of 5 indicates the report is entirely aligned with the source emails.
Fluency (1-3): The quality of the report in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure.
Practicality (1-5) - The report should enable the reader to quickly identify next steps, make informed decisions, or efficiently manage their tasks. A higher score indicates the report contains clearly actionable information and is directly helpful for the reader’s priorities.
Readability (1-5) - The report should be visually easy to follow, with clear structuring (headings, paragraphs, bullet points, etc.) that helps the reader quickly identify key points. Consider whether the text is neatly organized into sections or lists, and whether the formatting (spacing, line breaks) is appropriate. A higher score indicates that the reader can skim or read the document with minimal effort, easily locating important information.
Relevance (1-5) - The report should contain the most important content from the original emails. Irrelevant or redundant information should be minimized. A higher score indicates the report effectively captures the key points without unnecessary details.
