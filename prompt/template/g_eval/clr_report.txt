You will be given a daily report that was compiled from multiple email summaries.

Your task is to rate the report on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer back to them as needed during your review.

Evaluation Criteria:

Clearance (1-5) - The report should minimize or eliminate duplicated information, outdated details, and any extraneous content. A higher score indicates the content is streamlined, containing only current, necessary, and distinct details without repetitive or obsolete information.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Identify Redundancies
- Check if the same information is repeated multiple times.
- See if there are near-duplicates across different parts of the report.

2. Check for Outdated or Irrelevant Information
- Note any content that seems no longer applicable (past deadlines, resolved issues, etc.).
- Determine if such content should have been removed or condensed.

3. Assess Overall Brevity and Focus
- Does the report feel concise, covering only essential and up-to-date points?
- Are old or irrelevant details adequately omitted?

4. Assign a Clearance Score (1–5)
- 1: The report is cluttered with duplicates, redundancies, or outdated material.
- 2–3: The report attempts to remove unnecessary content but still contains noticeable repetition or old data.
- 4: Mostly clear of duplicates and outdated info; only minor improvements needed.
- 5: Very clean and concise; no noticeable redundancies or irrelevant content.
